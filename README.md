# Nasa APOD App

This is a web app which displays information on the Nasa Astronomy Picture of the Day using Nasa's API

To use this on your own machine, you must get an API key from the NASA [APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod) page.

Then create a .env file in the working directory and write:
`VITE_NASA_API_KEY = "your api key"`
